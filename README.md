# Connect-Four
This Project will be using C++ with the IDE QT Creater and a (hopefully) working unbeatable AI. The Backup folder contains code that creates a tree of every single possible iteration of the Connect 4 game board which results in about 4531985219092 possibles or nodes and assuming best case scenario were each node is one byte program takes about 4.5 TB of ram (which doesn't btw because each node is not one byte and it is four bytes so this program will take 18 TB of ram instead) so that idea wasn't gonna work. Instead, I created a modified program that deletes useless nodes at runtime making this program extremely memory efficient (at testing I hadn't seen my program go over 10 MB!) only problem is I haven't been able to test my program because it still creates about 4531985219092 nodes which takes a long time to compute but I believe if time isn't a problem this should run fine. Plus this is only the case in impossible mode everything else is fine and fun. 

IMPORTANT: SINCE THIS CODE IN IMPOSSIBLE MODE CREATES AND DELETES A LOT OF NODES A LOT OF READS AND WRITES ARE DONE TO YOUR RAM ANY DAMAGES IS NOT MY PROBLEM IN OR OUT OF IMPOSSIBLE MODE.
